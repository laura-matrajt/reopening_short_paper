This is the repository of files used in the manuscript entitled "Quantifying the Impact of Lifting Community Nonpharmaceutical Interventions for COVID-19 During Vaccination Rollout in the United States", https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/8/7/ofab341/6311669, Open Forum Infectious Diseases, 2021

In this paper, we estimated the potential impact on mortality and total infections of completely lifting community nonpharmaceutical interventions when only a small proportion of the population has been fully vaccinated in 2 states in the United States. Lifting all community nonpharmaceutical interventions immediately is predicted to result in twice as many deaths over the next 6 months as a more moderate reopening allowing 70% of prepandemic contacts.

Keep in mind that some of the files needed to run this paper might be in these repositories within my account:
- one_vs_two_doses 
- data
- vaccine_optimization (maybe)
